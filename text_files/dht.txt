TL;DR: It only matters if you are actively stealing from people, there are no random searches.\n\n\"If you get searched and you are wearing a stolen item (or have one in your inventory) it may be off to prison with you. This will usually happen if you rob a merchant or whatever, go though that search, then rob another one and get searched again. If you do not perform another robbery then you won't get busted no matter what, you don't get searched at random.\""},"777319606029123595":{"u":1,"t":1605397835977,"m":"been a good run so far, this next island should really ramp up the fun and crazyness of the game too"},"777335325374152724":{"u":3,"t":1605401583761,"m":"<@!332365174864347136> if u wanna play our duo game at all tonight lemme know"},"777335335817969696":{"u":3,"t":1605401586251,"m":"I’m down"},"777338111989645312":{"u":4,"t":1605402248142,"m":"I will be home in a little bit and we could play some more if you guys are around"},"777338144814399488":{"u":3,"t":1605402255968,"m":"im down"},"777338536767520828":{"u":4,"t":1605402349417,"m":"<@332365174864347136>"},"777339207789576203":{"u":1,"t":1605402509401,"m":"sure"},"777346059885215764":{"u":1,"t":1605404143068,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777346059680088084/lizard.jpg"}]},"777346352358621254":{"u":3,"t":1605404212799,"m":"smells worse ova here than a dozen rotten eggs dropped in a vat of vinega'"},"777347357511647252":{"u":1,"t":1605404452446,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777347357321854998/BigDickWizard6969.jpg"}]},"777349141386362921":{"u":1,"t":1605404877755,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777349141666988112/7lkmg5gz1ih21.jpg"}]},"777350619593441310":{"u":4,"t":1605405230187,"m":"Omw home 15-20"},"777357285772230676":{"u":4,"t":1605406819528,"m":"<@!146745705250291712> <@!332365174864347136>"},"777357332027015198":{"u":1,"t":1605406830556,"m":"oh shit"},"777357335676846111":{"u":1,"t":1605406831426,"m":"its time"},"777588650116382742":{"u":1,"t":1605461981086,"m":"Ok i just realized in Spotify that the E doesn't mean Everyone, IE no profanity, but Explicit.
