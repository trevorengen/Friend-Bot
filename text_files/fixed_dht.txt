TL;DR: It only matters if you are actively stealing from people, there are no random searches.\n\n\"If you get searched and you are wearing a stolen item (or have one in your inventory) it may be off to prison with you. This will usually happen if you rob a merchant or whatever, go though that search, then rob another one and get searched again. If you do not perform another robbery then you won't get busted no matter what, you don't get searched at random.\" 777319606029123595 been a good run so far, this next island should really ramp up the fun and crazyness of the game too 777335325374152724 <@!332365174864347136> if u wanna play our duo game at all tonight lemme know 777335335817969696 I’m down 777338111989645312 I will be home in a little bit and we could play some more if you guys are around 777338144814399488 im down 777338536767520828 <@332365174864347136> 777339207789576203 sure"},"777346059885215764":{"u":1,"t":1605404143068,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777346059680088084/lizard.jpg"}]},"777346352358621254":{"u":3,"t":1605404212799,"m":"smells worse ova here than a dozen rotten eggs dropped in a vat of vinega'"},"777347357511647252":{"u":1,"t":1605404452446,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777347357321854998/BigDickWizard6969.jpg"}]},"777349141386362921":{"u":1,"t":1605404877755,"a":[{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479497005119438849/777349141666988112/7lkmg5gz1ih21.jpg"}]},"777350619593441310":{"u":4,"t":1605405230187,"m":"Omw home 15-20 777357285772230676 <@!146745705250291712> <@!332365174864347136> 777357332027015198 oh shit 777357335676846111 its time 777588650116382742 Ok i just realized in Spotify that the E doesn't mean Everyone, IE no profanity, but Explicit.

It's not an Anime, so its hard to compare it as such.

You do actually! 701316887069458442 In constantly recruiting cuz I'm constantly loosing troops in battle 701316947563905024 so how do you recruit people then? is it just resources? 701317033987407895 That said there's a SHITLOAD of battle I've fought where I didn't suffer a single wounded troop even. We own 701317111175315507 So there's multiple ways to recruit troops 701317224388100166 The main way is to recruit peasants. You show up to a small village and just ask if anyone is willing to join you 701317366675669023 It costs money to hire them, and every troop also gets a salary or a certain amount of gold per day 701317419565580349 You also have to buy food and feed them 701317477833113600 shit 701317550319075409 I think I asked before but its one consistent world right? for everyone? 701317562947993760 Like right now i actually have several work horses and packmules packing a shitload of grain and dried meats to feed my troops 701317655310762074 thats dope 701317672734031902 Uhhhh like...

The multiplayer is just skirmishes and battles 701317821891870730 Oh 701317855714607164 whaat 701317864073723905 The mp doesn't include the overworld or campaign 701317964204343347 how hard is it to get into 701318039483842690 Which is really the main part of a mount and blade game. The mp is just a fun side thing 701318141451567104 Hmmmm... Honestly not that hard.

I don't know how he would react but I know if one of you guys came to me with an issue that was causing serious strife in our friendship I would want to proactively try to fix it. 673365693659349045 yeah the second one 672678827335483425 <@332365174864347136> @ me when u wanna play rust 672684614778617856 😮 672686904705286144 <@!332365174864347136> <@!146745705250291712> <@!336264270864187393> want to play.....not rust? 672693799214120971 yeah im down 672695328830390287 <@!332365174864347136> ' 672698369189347348 <@!336264270864187393> nut up or shut your beautiful DSL 672701815816585216 what does that mean 672701831612334096 what u wanna play 672701889598455818 actually i got like 15 min on av queue 672705083267612672 ffs dude 672707066871414805 30 min 672707082214047784 what do u even wanna play 672711171312451632 lol 672711194854948875 we have been playing for like hours 672711207945240579 now we are done 672711312861822978 what rank are you 672711343148761088 yeahh i didnt realize what time it was 672711389789290508 rank 6 lol i can only go one at a time 672711549378494474 dang dude sweet 672711561114025984 officers tabard 672711585697103872 /flex 672712290440708108 hey next week 672712296002355200 i get gear 672712313375162388 and its still bis 672712609455407122 until bwl 672713067586519052 no even through phase 3 672713281953202192 all of it is bis besides and also wsg exalted bracers 672713312613564429 the besides wasnt supposed to be there 672923607982145546 Oof.

They had dope ass suit sound design. Like you could hear tiny servos and mechanical parts whirring around as he moved 663247175576190986 The end game random dungeon map thing is really cool 663247270833160203 I actually didnt know it was made by the diablo team but that makes sense it seems really quality but I never really heard all that much about the game which surprised me 663247315729121321 Main issue is that engineer or mechanic or whatever is much much much stronger than the other classes 663247400881750025 Yeah i feel like it should be more popular 663247426408153128 Yeahh thats what I always played theyre like elemental berserkers 663247461694832640 Yeah they own 663247509572943892 I never played the first one 663247575863787551 1st one is really cool. A bit different. Only 3 classes and no multiplayer 663247656184709140 If you played the 2nd there isn't much if a reason to go back to the 1st 663247757309640723 But the classes are totally different so it's a different experience 663247889820286987 I think gems and slotting works differently but that's the main difference 663255332981571594 we should play poe sometime 663255337951821854 the gang 663255650834448384 The skill tree in poe pisses me off 663255663312371752 But I'd be down 663255779893313538 Skill tree.
